	<h1>hi <3</h1>
	<p>
		I'm kf, a coder currently working on the data team at <a href="https://simple.com">Simple</a> in Portland, OR.

		At the moment, I work on search, streaming, and data ingestion. Previously, I focused on building distributed systems--especially distributed key-value stores--with some of those systems built on OpenStack. Most of my experience is in functional programming using languages like Scala, Clojure, Elixir, Haskell, and Common Lisp. I'm most experienced with Scala, but Clojure is my favorite, at the moment!

		I've been coding professionally for about 2.5 years now, after having gone to college for English and math education. I'm primarily self-taught; I learned to code by moving to San Francisco and attending meetups. You can find a <a href="friendgineering.html">list of my favorites in various cities here</a>.

		In my spare time, I'm interested in STEM education and diversity in tech. I'm on the board for <a href="http://clojurebridge.org">ClojureBridge</a>, a non-profit that offers free workshops in Clojure for women, as well as <a href="http://bridgefoundry.org">Bridge Foundry</a>, a non-profit that supports free programming workshops for underrepresented groups in technology. I mentor at the <a href="http://www.reed.edu/sds/">Software Design Studio</a> for Reed College, coordinate volunteers for <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org">Open Source Bridge</a>, and occasionally organize <a href="http://plibmttbhgaty.com">Programming Languages I've Been Meaning To Try But Haven't Gotten Around To Yet</a>. Before moving to Portland, I was also a key member at <a href="https://www.doubleunion.org/">Double Union</a>, co-organizer for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Philadelphia/">Philly chapter of Papers We Love</a>, and mentor at <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a>.

		When I'm not busy coding, I enjoy Saturday brunches, early '00s pop music, getting my <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/v/ameliahart">hair done</a>, and taking selfies with my cat, Dallas.
